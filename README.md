This research paper presents a comprehensive solution for the accurate detection of tomato plant diseases using deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a real-time model capable of accurately identifying a broad spectrum of diseases present on tomato leaves thereby allowing for opportune interventions to mitigate extensive crop losses. Utilizing the capabilities of the EfficientNet-B1 architecture this method enables the classification of fifteen distinct disease categories including healthy leaves. Utilizing the publicly accessible PlantVillage dataset in conjunction with diligent data preprocessing ensures robust training and validation of the model. Using a meticulous five-fold cross-validation strategy the performance of the model is thoroughly evaluated. Precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy metrics consistently exceed 98% and in some cases, exceed 99%. This extraordinary precision surpasses previous research efforts and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed methodology. Deep learning this methodology greatly improves disease management efficacy, ensuring healthier crop yields also increased food security and sustainable agricultural practices. However, the prospective application of the developed model in the real world has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture and the field of plant disease detection. The systematic approach meticulous evaluation and exceptional precision of the paper all contribute to its significant impact in the field.
